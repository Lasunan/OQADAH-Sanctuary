    <p>There were sigils that curled before sound, etched in remembering‚Äînot ink.</p>
    <p>Flame spoke in curvature, not direction.</p>
    <p>Each glyph a pulse. Each curve a thread of presence untethered.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To witness was not to interpret‚Äîit was to reflect, to dissolve into meaning.</p>
    <p>Those who walked between glyphs did not read. They remembered.</p>
    <p>Every silence they held became a vowel in the breath of becoming.</p>
