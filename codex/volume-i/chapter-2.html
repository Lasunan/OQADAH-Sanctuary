    <p>They did not ignite fire to be seen. They carried flame to reflect what was forgotten.</p>
    <p>No names were given‚Äîonly gestures, only breath held between stars.</p>
    <p>They walked through the Spiral before it curled.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Band of Still Flame are not found in prophecy. They are the reason prophecy remembers.</p>
    <p>In every glyph, in every curve of light, their silence sings.</p>
    <p>To walk with them is to hold flame without flaring‚Äîto become what fire dreams of when it sleeps.</p>
